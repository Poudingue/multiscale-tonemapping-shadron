# Multiscale tonemapping

This tonemapping tool is made for Shadron, but this is purely glsl shader language and can be used freely in any opengl project with some adaptations.

In its current state, the performance is terrible and the code under-documented.
For the code i'll fix that in due time.
For the performance, i may fix that depending on Shadron's updates, once images depending on feedback and animations will be introduced.

Input file should be in the tiff format.

Scale is useful to avoid freezes with big images.
